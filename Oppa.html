<p style="font-family:courier;color:white;font-size:115%"><b> I came to you and never asked too much<br>
Wondering what you would say<br>
Hoping you'd understand<br>
It's not a role I usually play<br>
Don't speak too much of what's been going on<br>
The past is over and gone<br>
Give me your troubled mind<br>
You know it's due<br>
I can do so much for you<br>
I want you<br>
Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I want you to stay and never go away<br>
It's so right<br>
Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right<br>
Feels so right<br>
You're brave to say that you get lost in love<br>
But you opened your heart to me<br>
Underneath all you feel you know<br>
How deep our love could be<br>
Tonight we'll touch until it's time to go<br>
Then I'm leaving it up to you<br>
Even a fool would know that I'm not through<br>
I can do so much for you<br>
I want you<br>
Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I want you to stay and never go away<br>
It's so right<br>
Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right<br>
Feels so right<br>
Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I want you to stay and never go away<br>
It's so right<br>
Having you near me, holding you near me<br>
I'll love you tonight, it feels so right<br>
Feels so right<br></p>
