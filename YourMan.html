<p style="font-family:courier;color:white;font-size:125%"> <b>Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low<br>
And put some music on that's soft and slow<br>
Baby, we ain't got no place to go<br>
I hope you understand<br>
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long<br>
Never felt a feeling quite this strong<br>
I can't believe how much it turns me on<br>
Just to be your man<br>
There's no hurry, don't you worry<br>
We can take our time<br>
Come a little closer, let's go over<br>
What I had in mind<br>
Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low<br>
And put some music on that's soft and slow<br>
Baby, we ain't got no place to go<br>
I hope you understand<br>
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long<br>
Never felt a feeling quite this strong<br>
I can't believe how much it turns me on<br>
Just to be your man<br>
Ain't nobody ever love nobody<br>
The way that I love you<br>
We're alone now<br>
You don't know how long I've wanted to<br>
Lock the door and turn the lights down low<br>
And put some music on that's soft and slow<br>
Baby, we ain't got no place to go<br>
I hope you understand<br>
I've been thinking 'bout this all day long<br>
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong<br>
I can't believe how much it turns me on<br>
Just to be your man<br>
I can't believe how much it turns me on<br>
Just to be your man</b><br></p>
